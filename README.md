# Game-Recommender-System
A game recommender system using content based filtering

The word recommend is a very common word used by us when we for instance want to watch a new movie, series or anime but don't know what to choose from . Maybe you want to listen to a new genre, let's say Kpop but don't know which song to start listening to or you really liked playing Call of Duty:Black Ops and don't know what to play next. When we are provided by numerous choices, we often tend to seek for an opinion or a recommendation let's say a person or a platform (Netflix or Spotify) and also expect that we like it.

But there are moments we don't like the recommendations given to us. That's why understanding a customer, user or individual as well as their tastes/choices is essential before recommending something.

In this project I am going to use a dataset that was available at Kaggle and develop a game recommender system.
